# This R markdown document
This document present workshop materials initially presented in the Forecast Challenge part of the GLEON2022 workshop "Introduction to real-time lake forecasting: learn, teach, and generate forecasts with Macrosystems EDDIE modules and the NEON Forecasting Challenge." The materials have been modified slightly for use in additional workshops.

To complete the workshop via this markdown document the following packages will need to be installed:

* `remotes`
* `fpp3`
* `tsibble`
* `tidyverse`
* `lubridate`
* `neon4cast` (from github)

The following code chunk should be run to install packages.

```{r eval = F}
install.packages('remotes')
install.packages('fpp3') # package for applying simple forecasting methods
install.packages('tsibble') # package for dealing with time series data sets and tsibble objects
install.packages('tidyverse') # collection of R packages for data manipulation, analysis, and visualisation
install.packages('lubridate') # working with dates and times
remotes::install_github('eco4cast/neon4cast') # package from NEON4cast challenge organisers to assist with forecast building and submission
```

Additionally, R version 4.2 is required to run the neon4cast package. It's also worth checking your Rtools is up to date and compatible with R 4.2, see (https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/rtools42/rtools.html). 


```{r}
version$version.string

library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
```

If you do not wish to run the code yourself you can follow along via the html (NEON_forecast_challenge_workshop.md), which can be downloaded from the [Github repository](https://github.com/OlssonF/NEON-forecast-challenge-workshop). 

# Introduction to NEON forecast challenge

The EFI RCN NEON Forecast Challenge asks the scientific community to produce ecological forecasts of future conditions at NEON sites by leveraging NEON's open data products. The Challenge is split into five themes that span aquatic and terrestrial systems, and population, community, and ecosystem processes across a broad range of ecoregions. We are excited to use this Challenge to learn more about the predictability of ecological processes by forecasting NEON data before it is collected.  
  
Which modeling frameworks, mechanistic processes, and statistical approaches best capture community, population, and ecosystem dynamics? These questions are answerable by a community generating a diverse array of forecasts. The Challenge is open to any individual or team from anywhere around the world that wants to submit forecasts. Sign up [here.](https://projects.ecoforecast.org/neon4cast-docs/Participation.html). 

## Aquatics challenge

What: Freshwater surface water temperature, oxygen, and chlorophyll-a.

Where: 7 lakes and 27 river/stream NEON sites.

When: Daily forecasts for at least 30-days in the future. New forecast submissions, that use new data to update the forecast, are accepted daily. The only requirement is that submissions are predictions of the future at the time the forecast is submitted.

Today we will focus on lake sites only and will start with forecasting water temperature. For the challenge, you can chose to submit to either the lakes, rivers or streams or all three! You can also chose to submit any of the three focal variables (temperature, oxygen, and chlorophyll). Find more information about the aquatics challenge [here](https://projects.ecoforecast.org/neon4cast-docs/Aquatics.html).

## Submission requirements

For the Challange, forecasts must include quantified uncertainty. The file can represent uncertainty using an ensemble forecast (multiple realizations of future conditions) or a distribution forecast (with mean and standard deviation), specified in the family and parameter columns of the forecast file. 

For an ensemble forecast, the `family` column uses the word `ensemble` to designate that it is a ensemble forecast and the parameter column is the ensemble member number (1, 2, 3 …).  For a distribution forecast, the `family` column uses the word `normal` to designate a normal distribution and the parameter column must have the words mu and sigma for each forecasted variable, site_id, and datetime. For forecasts that don't have a normal distribution we recommend using the ensemble format and sampling from your non-normal distribution to generate a set of ensemble members that represents your distribution. I will go through examples of both `ensemble` and `normal` forecasts as examples. 

The full list of required columns and format can be found in the [Challenge documentation](https://projects.ecoforecast.org/neon4cast-docs/Submission-Instructions.html).

# The forecasting workflow
## Read in the data

We start forecasting by first looking at the historic data - called the 'targets'. These data are available near real-time, with the latency of approximately 24-48 hrs. Here is how you read in the data from the targets file available from the EFI server. 

```{r eval=TRUE, echo = TRUE, error=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
#read in the targets data
targets <- read_csv('targets-neon-chla.csv')
target_sites <- targets |> distinct(site_id) |> pull()

```

Information on the NEON sites can be found in the `NEON_Field_Site_Metadata_20220412.csv` file on GitHub. It can be filtered to only include aquatic sites. This table has information about the field sites, including location, ecoregion, information about the watershed (e.g. elevation, mean annual precipitation and temperature), and lake depth. 
 
```{r eval=TRUE, echo = TRUE, error=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# read in the sites data
aquatic_sites <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eco4cast/neon4cast-targets/main/NEON_Field_Site_Metadata_20220412.csv") |>
  dplyr::filter(field_site_id %in% target_sites)
```

Let's take a look at the targets data!
```{r eval = T, echo = F}
glimpse(targets)

```

The columns of the targets file show the time step (daily for aquatics challenge), the 4 character site code (`site_id`), the variable being measured, and the mean daily observation. Here we are looking only at two lake sites (`BARC` and `SUGG`) chlorophyll (`chla`) observations.

## Visualise the data
```{r eval = T, echo = F, warning=FALSE, fig.dim=c(10,10), fig.cap='Figure: Chlorophyll targets data at two lake sites provided by EFI for the NEON forecasting challgenge.'}

targets %>%
  ggplot(., aes(x = datetime, y = observation)) +
  geom_point() +   
  theme_bw() + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1, vjust = 0.5)) +
  facet_wrap(~site_id, scales = 'free_y')+
  labs(title = 'chla')

```

Chlorophyll concentration is a proxy used in water quality monitoring for algal biomass. Large chlorophyll values are indication of algal blooms and important water quality parameter. Chlorophyll concentration in natural waters is driven by a complex interaction of temperatures, nutrients, hydroynamic conditions that is not well quantified and can be quite stochastic in nature. 

# Introducing co-variates

One important step to overcome when thinking about generating forecasts is to include co-variates in the model. A chlorophyll forecast, for example, may be benefit from information about past and future weather. The neon4cast challenge package includes functions for downloading past and future NOAA weather forecasts for all of the NEON sites. The 3 types of data are as follows:

* stage_1: raw forecasts - 31 member ensemble forecasts at 3 hr intervals for the first 10 days, and 6 hr intervals for up to 35 days at the NEON sites.
* stage_2: a processed version of Stage 1 in which fluxes are standardized to per second rates, fluxes and states are interpolated to 1 hour intervals and variables are renamed to match conventions. We recommend this for obtaining future weather by using `neon4cast::noaa_stage2()`. Future weather forecasts include a 30-member ensemble of equally likely future weather conditions.
* stage_3: can be viewed as the "historical" weather and is combination of day 1 weather forecasts (i.e., when the forecasts are most accurate). You can download this “stacked” NOAA product using `neon4cast::noaa_stage3()`.

These functions create a connection to the dataset hosted on the eco4cast server. To download the data you have to tell the function to `collect()` it. These data set can be subsetted and filtered using `dplyr` functions prior to download to limit the memory usage.

You can read more about the NOAA forecasts available for the NEON sites [here:](https://projects.ecoforecast.org/neon4cast-docs/Shared-Forecast-Drivers.html)

## Download co-variates
### Download historic data

We will generate a chlorophyll using `air_temperature` and `eastward_wind` as a co-variate. 
Note: This code chunk can take a few minutes to execute as it accesses the NOAA data depending on your internet connection.

```{r, message=FALSE}
# past stacked weather
df_past <- neon4cast::noaa_stage3()

variables <- c("air_temperature", "eastward_wind")
#Other variable names can be found at https://projects.ecoforecast.org/neon4cast-docs/Shared-Forecast-Drivers.html#stage-3

noaa_past <- df_past |> 
  dplyr::filter(site_id %in% target_sites,
                datetime >= ymd('2017-01-01'),
                variable %in% variables) |> 
  dplyr::collect()

noaa_past[1:10,]
```

This is a stacked ensemble forecast of the one day ahead forecasts. To get an estimate of the historic conditions we can take a mean of these ensembles. We will also need to convert the temperatures to Celsius from Kelvin.

```{r}
# aggregate the past to mean values
noaa_past_mean <- noaa_past |> 
  mutate(datetime = as_date(datetime)) |> 
  group_by(datetime, site_id, variable) |> 
  summarize(prediction = mean(prediction, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = "drop") |> 
  pivot_wider(names_from = variable, values_from = prediction) |> 
  # convert air temp to C
  mutate(air_temperature = air_temperature - 273.15)
```

We can then look at the future weather forecasts in the same way but using the `noaa_stage2()`. The forecast becomes available from NOAA at 5am UTC the following day, so we take the air temperature forecast from yesterday (`noaa_date`) to make the water quality forecasts. Then we can use the ensembles to produce uncertainty in the chlorophyll forecast by forecasting multiple (31) future water temperatures. 

### Download future weather forecasts

```{r, message=FALSE}
# Note: New forecast only available at 5am UTC the next day - so if forecasting in realtime look for yesterday's forecast

# generate forecast(s) for June 2023
forecast_date <- as_date('2023-06-01')

df_future <- neon4cast::noaa_stage2()

variables <- c("air_temperature", "eastward_wind")

noaa_future <- df_future |> 
  dplyr::filter(reference_datetime == forecast_date,
                datetime >= forecast_date,
                site_id %in% target_sites,
                variable %in% variables) |> 
  dplyr::collect()
```

The forecasts are hourly and we are interested in using daily mean air temperature for water temperature forecast generation.

```{r warning=F}
noaa_future_daily <- noaa_future |> 
  mutate(datetime = as_date(datetime)) |> 
  # mean daily forecasts at each site per ensemble
  group_by(datetime, site_id, parameter, variable) |> 
  summarize(prediction = mean(prediction)) |>
  pivot_wider(names_from = variable, values_from = prediction) |>
  # convert to Celsius
  mutate(air_temperature = air_temperature - 273.15) |> 
  select(datetime, site_id, air_temperature, parameter, eastward_wind)

noaa_future_daily[1:10,]
```
Now we have a timeseries of historic data and a 30 member ensemble forecast of future air temperatures.

```{r echo = F, fig.cap = c('Figure: historic and future NOAA air temeprature forecasts at lake sites', 'Figure: last two months of historic air temperature forecasts and 35 day ahead forecast')}
ggplot(noaa_future_daily, aes(x=datetime, y=air_temperature)) +
  geom_line(aes(group = parameter), alpha = 0.4)+
  geom_line(data = noaa_past_mean, colour = 'darkblue') +
  facet_wrap(~site_id, scales = 'free')

ggplot(noaa_future_daily, aes(x=datetime, y=air_temperature)) +
  geom_line(aes(group = parameter), alpha = 0.4)+
  geom_line(data = noaa_past_mean, colour = 'darkblue') +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(forecast_date - days(60),
                           forecast_date + days(35)))+
  facet_wrap(~site_id, scales = 'free')
```

# Model 1: Linear model with covariates

We will fit a simple linear model between historic air temperature and the chlorophyll targets data. Using this model we can then use our future estimates of air temperature (all 30 ensembles) to estimate chlorophyll at each site. The ensemble weather forecast will therefore propagate uncertainty into the chlorophyll forecast and give an estimate of driving data uncertainty. 

We will start by joining the historic weather data with the targets to aid in fitting the linear model.

```{r}
targets_lm <- targets |> 
  pivot_wider(names_from = 'variable', values_from = 'observation') |> 
  left_join(noaa_past_mean, 
            by = c("datetime","site_id"))

targets_lm[1050:1060,]
```


To fit the linear model we use the base R `lm()` but there are also methods to fit linear (and non-linear) models in the `fable::` package. You can explore the [documentation](https://otexts.com/fpp3/regression.html) for more information on the `fable::TSLM()` function. We can fit a separate linear model for each site. For example, at Lake Suggs, this would look like:

```{r, eval = F}
example_site <- 'SUGG'

site_target <- targets_lm |> 
  filter(site_id == example_site)

noaa_future_site <- noaa_future_daily |> 
  filter(site_id == example_site)

#Fit linear model based on past data: chla = m * air temperature + b
fit <- lm(site_target$chla ~ site_target$air_temperature + site_target$eastward_wind)
    
# use linear regression to forecast water temperature for each ensemble member
forecasted_temperature <- fit$coefficients[1] + 
  fit$coefficients[2] * noaa_future_site$air_temperature +
  fit$coefficients[3] * noaa_future_site$eastward_wind

```

We can loop through this for each site to create a site-wise forecast of water temperature based on a linear model and each forecasted air temperature. We can run this forecast for each site and then bind them together to submit as one forecast. 


## Specify forecast model

```{r}
temp_lm_forecast <- NULL

for(i in 1:length(target_sites)) {  
  
  site <- target_sites[i]
  
  site_target <- targets_lm |>
    filter(site_id == site)

  noaa_future_site <- noaa_future_daily |> 
    filter(site_id == site)
  
  #Fit linear model based on past data: water temperature = m * air temperature + b
  fit <- lm(site_target$chla ~ site_target$air_temperature + site_target$eastward_wind)
  # fit <- lm(site_target$temperature ~ ....)
    
  # use linear regression to forecast water temperature for each ensemble member
  forecasted_temperature <- 
    fit$coefficients[1] +
    (fit$coefficients[2] * noaa_future_site$air_temperature) + 
    (fit$coefficients[3] * noaa_future_site$air_temperature) 
    
  # put all the relavent information into a tibble that we can bind together
  chla <- tibble(datetime = noaa_future_site$datetime,
                        site_id = site,
                        parameter = noaa_future_site$parameter,
                        prediction = forecasted_temperature,
                        variable = "chla")
  
  temp_lm_forecast <- dplyr::bind_rows(temp_lm_forecast, chla)
  message(site, ' temperature forecast run')
  
}
```

We now have 30 possible forecasts of water temperature at each site and each day. On this plot each line represents one of the possible forecasts and the range of forecasted water temperature is a simple quantification of the uncertainty in our forecast.

Looking back at the forecasts we produced:

```{r, echo = F, warning = F}
temp_lm_forecast %>% 
  ggplot(.,aes(x=datetime, y=prediction, group = parameter)) + 
  geom_point(data = targets,aes(x=datetime, y=observation, group = 'obs'), colour = 'darkblue') +
  geom_line(alpha = 0.3, aes(colour = 'ensemble member (parameter)')) + 
  facet_wrap(~site_id, scales = 'free_y') +
  scale_x_date(expand = c(0,0), date_labels = "%d %b") +
  labs(y = 'value') +
  geom_vline(aes(linetype = 'reference_datetime', xintercept = Sys.Date()), colour = 'blue', size = 1.5) +
  labs(title = 'site_id', subtitle = 'variable = temperature', caption = 'prediction') + 
  annotate("text", x = Sys.Date() - days(10), y = 20, label = "past")  +
  annotate("text", x = Sys.Date() + days(12), y = 20, label = "future")  +
  theme_bw() +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(min(temp_lm_forecast$datetime) - 15,
                           Sys.Date() + 30)) 
```

## Convert to EFI standard for submission to the Challenge
Forecast standards are useful for maintaining consistent formats across forecast generations. For the NEON forecast Challenge (including the aquatics theme) the following standards are specified for a forecast.  For an ensemble forecast the documentation specifies the following columns:

* `datetime`: forecast timestamp for each time step
* `reference_datetime`: The start of the forecast; this should be 0 times steps in the future. This should only be one value of reference_datetime in the file
* `site_id`: NEON code for site
* `family`: name of probability distribution that is described by the parameter values in the parameter column; only `normal` or `ensemble` are currently allowed.
* `parameter`: integer value for forecast replicate (from the `.rep` in fable output);
* `variable`: standardized variable name from the theme 
* `prediction`: forecasted value (from the `.sim` column in fable output)
* `model_id`: model name (no spaces)

We need to make sure the dataframe is in the correct format and then we can submit this to the challenge as well! This is an ensemble forecast (specified in the `family` column). 

```{r}
# Remember to change the model_id when you make changes to the model structure!
my_model_id <- 'your_model_id'

temp_lm_forecast_EFI <- temp_lm_forecast %>%
  mutate(model_id = my_model_id,
         reference_datetime = as_date(min(datetime)) - days(1),
         family = 'ensemble',
         parameter = as.character(parameter)) %>%
  select(model_id, datetime, reference_datetime, site_id, family, parameter, variable, prediction)
```

## Optional: Submit forecast
Files need to be in the correct format for submission. The forecast organizers have created tools to help aid in the submission process. These tools can be downloaded from Github using `remotes::install_github(eco4cast/neon4cast)`.
These include functions for submitting, scoring and reading forecasts:

* `submit()` - submit the forecast file to the neon4cast server where it will be scored
* `forecast_output_validator()` - will check the file is in the correct format to be submitted
* `check_submission()` - check that your submission has been uploaded to the server

The file name needs to be in the format theme-reference_datetime-model_id
```{r eval = T}
# Start by writing the forecast to file
theme <- 'aquatics'
date <- temp_lm_forecast_EFI$reference_datetime[1]
forecast_name_1 <- paste0(temp_lm_forecast_EFI$model_id[1], ".csv")
forecast_file_1 <- paste(theme, date, forecast_name_1, sep = '-')
forecast_file_1

write_csv(temp_lm_forecast_EFI, forecast_file_1)

neon4cast::forecast_output_validator(forecast_file_1)

```

```{r eval = FALSE}
# can uses the neon4cast::forecast_output_validator() to check the forecast is in the right format
neon4cast::submit(forecast_file = forecast_file_1,
                  ask = FALSE) # if ask = T (default), it will produce a pop-up box asking if you want to submit
```

Is the linear model a reasonable relationship between air temperature and water temperature? Would some non-linear relationship be better? What about using yesterday's air and water temperatures to predict tomorrow? Or including additional parameters? There's a lot of variability in water temperatures unexplained by air temperature alone.

```{r, echo=F, warning=F}
ggplot(targets_lm, aes(x=eastward_wind, y= chla, colour = air_temperature)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_smooth(method = 'lm') +
  theme_bw() +
  facet_grid(~site_id)
```


## TASKS
Possible modifications to Model 1 - simple linear model: 

* Include additional NOAA co-variates in the linear model (remember to 'collect' and subset the right data from NOAA)
* Specify a non-linear relationship
* Try forecasting another variable (oxygen or chlorophyll) - could you use your water temperature to estimate dissolved oxygen concentration at the surface?
* Include a lag in the predictors

Remember to change the `model_id` so we can differentiate different forecasts!

## Register your participation
It's really important that once you start submitting forecasts to the Challenge that you register your participation. We ask that you complete this [form](https://nd.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_9MJ29y2xNrBOjqZ) which asks you some simple questions about your forecast and team. This is crucial for a couple of reasons:

1. We can keep track different forecast submissions during the scoring process to see which forecast is performing the best. Your `model_id` will be used to track the submissions so any new forecast model requires a new `model_id`.
2. The form gives consent for submissions to be included in Challenge-wide syntheses being carried out by the Challenge organisers. Partipants in the Challenge will be invited to join the synthesis projects on an opt-in basis. 

Questions about Challenge registration and synthesis participation can be directed to [Freya Olsson](mailto:freyao@vt.edu).
